# VGA_Controller_BASYS3
VGA Face @1080p (Verilog) Smiley face displayed on 1920x1080 VGA using Verilog. Controlled with 4 buttons (up/down/left/right). Uses a 148.5 MHz pixel clock generated via Clocking Wizard.
#  VGA Smiley Face Controller (1080p)

This Verilog project displays a smiley face on a Full HD (1920x1080) VGA monitor.  
The face can be moved across the screen using four directional push buttons (up, down, left, right).

The project uses a 148.5 MHz pixel clock, generated using **Xilinx Clocking Wizard**, following the standard 1080p VGA timing.
